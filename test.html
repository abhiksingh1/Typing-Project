  	const wording = ["1.) Unity refers to the extent to which all of the ideas contained within a given paragraph \"hang together\" in a way that is easy for the reader to \
understand.When the writer changes to a new idea -- one which is not consistent with the topic sentence of the paragraph -- the writer should begin a new paragraph.\
 Unity is important because it aids the reader in following along with the writer's ideas. The reader can expect that a given paragraph will deal only with one main \
  topic; when a new paragraph begins, this signals that the writer is moving on to a new topic.Consider the following example. Note that there are two main ideas \
  presented in this paragraph. The topic sentence indicates that the paragraph will deal with the subject of \"employees' attitudes,\" but the paragraph shifts \
   unexpectedly to the topic of \"management's attitudes.\" To achieve unity in this paragraph, the writer should begin a new paragraph when the switch is made \
    from employees to managers.", "2.) Employees' attitudes at Jonstone Electric Company should be improved. The workers do not feel that they are a working team instead of just individuals.\
 If people felt they were a part of a team, they would not misuse the tools, or deliberately undermine the work of others. Management's attitude toward its employees\
  should also be improved. Managers at Jonstone Electric act as though their employees are incapable of making decisions or doing their own work. Managers treat \
   workers like objects, not human beings.", "3.) Coherence refers to the extent to which the flow of ideas in a paragraph is easily understood by the reader. For this reason, coherence is closely \
 related to unity. When a writer changes main ideas or topics within a paragraph, confusion often results. To achieve coherence, then, a writer should show how all \
  of the ideas contained in a paragraph are relevant to the main topic.Consider the example below. In this paragraph, the writer begins with the topic of job-skills \
   courses, but veers off onto the topic of algebra and history before returning to the subject of courses on employment. As a result, the paragraph is disjointed and \
   difficult to understand.", "4.) Schools should offer courses to help students with the problems of unemployment. Such a course might begin with a discussion of where to find employment,\
 then cover resume writing and interviewing. Algebra and history don't help students with real-world needs. They are required courses that students aren't interested \
 in, and this is frustrating for students who would rather learn about other subjects. If schools offered job-skills courses, students would be well prepared for the \
  difficult task of finding a job once they finish school.", "5.) A paragraph is adequately developed when it describes, explains and supports the topic sentence. If the \"promise\" of the topic sentence is not\
 fulfilled, or if the reader is left with questions after reading the paragraph, the paragraph has not been adequately developed. Generally speaking, a paragraph\
  which consists of only two or three sentences is under-developed. A good rule of thumb to follow is to make sure that a paragraph contains at least four sentences\
   which explain and elaborate on the topic sentence.Consider the paragraph below. The topic sentence promises to discuss \"several\" points of comparison and contrast\
    between leadership and management, but the remainder of the paragraph falls short of fulfilling this promise. Only one point of comparison is raised, and this\
     point is left unexplained. Several questions remain unanswered. How are leaders different from managers? In what specific ways are the two alike? Why must a\
      manager be a good leader to be effective? Why must good leaders know how to manage people effectively? To achieve adequate development in this paragraph, these\
       questions should be addressed.", "6.) \"The topics of leadership and management are both similar to and different from one another in several important ways. To be effective, a manager\
 should be a good leader. And good leaders know how to manage people effectively.\"\
 \
Generally speaking, a paragraph should contain between three and five sentences, all of which help clarify and support the main idea of the paragraph. When a writer\
 begins a new paragraph, it signals to the reader that the writer is changing thoughts or ideas, or is moving on to discuss a different aspect of a main idea.", "7.) Beginning a paragraph with a topic sentence is one of the best ways to achieve clarity and unity in one's writing. The function of a topic sentence \
is to describe what the paragraph will be about, such that the reader has clear expectations about what will follow. An effective topic sentence typically contains\
 only one main idea. The remainder of the paragraph then develops that idea more fully, offering supporting points and examples. After reading a topic sentence, one \
  should be able to anticipate the type of information contained in the rest of the paragraph. If the remainder of the paragraph does not fulfill the \"promise\" of \
  the topic sentence, the paragraph will lack unity, coherence and adequate development.", "8.) \"The cockroaches that inhabit many city apartments and homes are parasites that are almost impossible to exterminate completely.\"\
\
Notice that this sentence clearly identifies that the key topic of the paragraph is cockroaches. It also indicates what the remainder of the paragraph will discuss: \
the difficulty of exterminating cockroaches. The reader can then expect the rest of the paragraph to explain how and why cockroaches are difficult to eliminate.\
\
\"Many television cartoons contain an unhealthy amount of violence.\"\
\
Notice that this sentence clearly identifies that the key topic of the paragraph is violence in television cartoons. It also indicates that the remainder of the \
paragraph will discuss how much violence cartoons typically contain, and how/why this violence is unhealthy for viewers.\
\
\"An increasing number of people in America are enjoying the benefits of organically grown fruits and vegetables.\"\
\
This topic sentence indicates that the remainder of the paragraph will cover the trend in the United States toward eating organic foods. The reader can also \
anticipate learning more in this paragraph about the specific benefits of organic foods.", "9.) Someone who weighs more than average can be curvy, well-built, full-bodied or heavy. (Curvy is usually only used to describe women.) You might also say \
someone has some meat on their bones. This is a casual way of saying they are overweight, and it might seem rude to someone sensitive. The opposite of overweight can \
be thin, slim or skinny.", "10.) How does a person look overall? If you think a woman is attractive, you can say she is beautiful, pretty or maybe even gorgeous (very beautiful). You \
can call an attractive man handsome. Both men and women can be good-looking. If you’re speaking very casually, good-looking men or women can be hot. To say someone \
is not very good-looking, you can say they are not much to look at. This is not a nice way to describe someone, but it’s better than ugly.", "11.) Population is defined as the total number of human beings in a particular city, state, or country. We can calculate approximately the number of \
resources required by a particular area if we know the total population of that area. Population is a cause of concern for many countries as increasing population \
demands for more resources and our planet is falling short of natural resources gradually. India is the second most populated country in the world and is facing the \
resource crisis consequently.\
\
There are various reasons behind population explosion and illiteracy is one of them. Majority of population in India is illiterate and weaker sections of the society \
tend to have more children as they don’t have knowledge about the birth control. Also, poor and illiterate class indulges in early marriage which ultimately results in \
more population as the young children are unaware of the facts related to reproduction.", "12.) Today we are going to discuss Patriotism Essay in English. Most people don’t know the meaning of Patriotism?  Patriotism means devotion to and \
vigorous support for one’s country. Today we have written an essay on Patriotism. Numerous filmmakers, journalists and editors have written and filmed about this \
topics. Patriotism essay in English in 100 words to 700 words. Patriotism essay for class 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Learn and give your feedback on Patriotism essay.", "13.) Demonetisation is the act of stripping currency units of its status as a legal tender. It occurs when current forms of money are pulled from \
circulation and replaced with new notes. Countries across the globe have used demonetisation to counterbalance the economic condition, to check inflation, corruption \
and to promote the cashless economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi orchestrated this master plan on 8th November 2016 by demonetizing the largest denomination 500 \
and 1000 banknotes of Mahatma Gandhi series. This is not the first time that India demonetized its currency earlier it was done in 1946 and 1978.", "14.) According to transparency internationals corruption India, even though India is still the most corrupt country in Asia. Corruption related reposts \
have reduced by 10% since 2015. India rating and research had concluded that only 12% of the ill-gotten money could be extracted with the idea of demonetization \
while 88% of black money is still in circulation in the Indian markets. It is very difficult to predict the effect of this movie on the economy and the citizens \
	in one sentence, destruction of fake money Indian economy will see a big boom. It will bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots. However, there may be \
so difficulties for a couple of months but this inconvenience shall be temporary and hardship in term may yield benefits in the long term.", "15.) Cities accommodate 31% of India’s population and contribute 63 per cent of GDP (census 2011). Urban areas are to house 40% of India’s population \
and contribute 75% of India’s GDP by 2030. This required comprehensive development of physical, institutional, social and economic infrastructure. The core \
infrastructure elements of the mission are adequate water supply, assured electricity supply, sanitation including soil waste management, efficient transport, good \
governance, sustainable environment, safety and security of citizens, robust it connectivity and health and education. The strategic components of a smart cities \
mission are city improvement (retrofitting) City renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (Green Field development) plus a pan-city initiative."];
